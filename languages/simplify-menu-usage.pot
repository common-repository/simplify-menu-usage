msgid "Choosing the default behavior is the standard way how WordPress handles inserting menu items downwards. To put it simply, if the next menu item is on the same level inserting downwards will be on the same level. If the next menu item has children elements, the item, which is about to be inserted/moved downwards will become a new children element of the next menu item. It should be familiar as it is the default way of handling the downwards move. For better visualization, the following image show the behavior."
